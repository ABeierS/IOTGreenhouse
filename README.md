# IOTGreenhouse
Team consisting of: Lasse Lundholm, Andreas Beier Søndergård
We have thought of developing some IOT features for a greenhouse. 
This can include temperature and humidity sensors both in the greenhouse and on the outside. With this you can make sure that the conditions for optimal growth. This can be connected to the internet so that a history of the enviroment in the greenhouse is available. Weather API can also be connected to warn the owner of possible harsh weather like heat, to help you remember to open a window or similar. 


Requirements:
Operating in temperature range of -10 to 50 degrees
Logging temperature and humidity in the greenhouse every 15 minutes
Post the data gathered to visualize the history of the climate in greenhous
Can send email/sms
Get weather forecast to warn the owner


Sensors:
DHT22 (Humidity and temperature) - 0-100%RH, (-40)-80 degrees celcius, resolution of 0.1C and 0.1% RH
Water level sensor, maybe just a distance sensor measuring on something floating on the water

Actuators:
Possible - Ultrasonic Atomizer Air Humidifier
