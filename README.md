# IOTGreenhouse
Team consisting of: Lasse Lundholm, Andreas Beier Søndergård
We have thought of developing some IOT features for a greenhouse. 
This can include temperature and humidity sensors both in the greenhouse and on the outside. With this you can make sure that the conditions for optimal growth. This can be connected to the internet so that a history of the enviroment in the greenhouse is available. Weather API can also be connected to warn the owner of possible harsh weather like heat, to help you remember to open a window or similar. 

Requirements:
Operating in temperature range of -10 to 50 degrees


Sensors:
DHT22 (Humidity and temperature) - 0-100%RH, (-40)-80 degrees celcius, resolution of 0.1C and 0.1% RH
Actuators:
Possible - Ultrasonic Atomizer Air Humidifier
